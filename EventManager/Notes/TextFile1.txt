12/18/17---------------------------------------

-Email notifier? I'm not sure how I want to implement the UI for this
	-Notify registrant when registration status changes
		-Confirmed
		-Standby
		-Declined?

-Open for Registrations Date in Event?
	-Add field to dbo.Event, update Entity Model and all Event views to show date
	-Update stored procedure that populates "Available Events" to check this field against current time

-Detailed Event/Registration management screen? 
	-Callsigns, notification specifications? I dunno...

-Click-thru? Allow links to bring users right to a view but still populate cache?


*DONE* -Make fullCalendar remember what month I was on prior to AJAX post (it was doing this, I fucked up by changing the ViewBag.Title and not updating the Reloader Function)
*DONE* -Add TOTAL HOURS dynamic to Event Entry form

-Message Display Footer? Have JSONResult/MessageBag pass messages back to view?

-Split the UserEventRegistration View into multiple views. Rethink the Async
-There is no reason why the UserEvents Page calls the ASync JSONResult Method on the CalendarView's controller.  This needs to be a Action result redirecting to the UserEvent's Index().  Using Async is not doing anything considering that the AJAX immediately refreshes the view anyways.  You idiot.

-EVENTS VIEW: 
	-EDIT EVENT should not show REPEATER on MOdal, unless you want to add duplicater.
	-ADD Calendarview Event Filters
		-My Events? AJAX GET with filter on Controller




-WORKFLOW:
	Adding an event:
		-Can an officer without a cruiser work?
